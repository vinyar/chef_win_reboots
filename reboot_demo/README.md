reboot_demo Cookbook
====================
This cookbook shows patterns for handling reboots on Windows.
These patterns allow for a single continuous chef client run across multiple reboots.

There are a couple of common scenarios for reboots:
* "No reboot pending" condition needs to exist in order to install an item/feature.
* Reboot needs to happen after installation of a component(s).
* Reboot needs to happen at the end of the chef run.
* Combination of conditions.
* Join AD as part of the chef client run

Patterns:
* Pattern 1 - Rapper recipe pattern.
> This pattern will run through the list of recipes and skip the entire recipe if there is a pending reboot.
> This is useful when you need multiple reboots during the chef client run.

* Pattern 2 - Resource level reboot handling.
> This pattern leverages the reboot_pending? method in Chef. Useful for skipping resources which depend on no-reboot-pending condition.
> For example, some roles and some patches require that there is no pending reboot prior to installation.
> Original prototype here: http://www.toddpigram.com/2013/10/testing-puppet-and-chef-cant-decide.html

* Pattern 3 - using custom library to determine state.
> Useful if your application has specific requirements for rebooting.
> Useful for older versions of chef-client before pending_reboot? was implemented.

* Pattern 4 - Reboot handler
> Using reboot handler from the Windows cookbook.
> This will cause a reboot at the end of the chef client run.

* Pattern 5 - Immediately rebuting in a middle of chef client run.
> Using 'raise' to elegantly end the chef run immediately and reboot.
> Will still run report handlers at the end.
> Handlers are skipped if you forcibly terminate the chef run.
> In this scenario node will not be saved because 'raise' exits the chef run. If node state needs to be captured, use node.save.

* Pattern 6 - using reboot resource
> Introduced in chef-client 12.x.x
> Note: There will likely be updates to the way this resource works.

* Pattern 7 - using guard interpreter
> Using guard interpeter for custom reboot detection
